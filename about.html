            </h2>
            <p class="section-2__text">There are at least few countries claiming to be the birth place of wine. But well, the truth is that there is only one that can hold the title. Georgia is the land where wine has been made for at least 8.000 years. There is no other place in the world that has evidence of wine making been found dating back that far. Wine made today with the traditional Georgian method follows the same process Georgians developed more than 8.000 years ago. How amazing is that, right?</p>
